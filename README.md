# Quizzard Trivia

## Introduction
Quizzard Trivia is a web based application designed using Java Script. Quizzard Trivia is the ultimate fun quiz that has been specifically designed for the ultimate Harry Potter fan also known as "Potterheads". The quiz consists of 30 hard questions that are based from the books and films. This quiz will test their knowledge and push their limits on how much that they really know about Harry Potter.

My approach for designing this quiz game application was to create it being mobile responsive first and for the game being accessible and easily played on through a range of different devices.

# Target Audience

Since readers young and old were first introduced to the 'boy who lived' -under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive -  fans have been spoilt with seven books and eight films.

It has since become one of the world's most-loved fictional worlds with grown adults still awaiting their letter from Hogwarts.

Many of us grew up alongside Harry, Ron and Hermione, glued to the books and eagerly awaiting the cinema releases, while younger generations are only just discovering the magical world beyond Platform 9 3/4.

Most of us will have seen every movie multiple times like me, and we all know someone who thinks theyâ€™re a Potter expert.

The quiz was designed in the mind for massive Harry Potter fans who are part of the worldwide fandom community.

The game hopes to attract 3 main types of players/users

1. Players who are massive Harry potter fans who are known as "Potterheads" in the fandom community.
2. Players who relatively new to Harry Potter and has just read all the books or watched the films. They just want to test their knowledge on how much they know so far.
3. Players who enjoyed reading the books and watching the films but they aren't considered fans but they will like to take up the challenge and test their Harry Potter knowledge.
